Chunky Mobile
=======
Chunky Mobile is an open source icon font that I designed while working on my lynda.com courses on Icon Fonts. Although there are a lot of high quality, open source icon fonts available, I felt that to truly teach someone to design an Icon Font I had to first design one myself. This is the result.

Chunky Mobile is heavily inspired by P.J. Onori's incredible Iconic font. It's optimized for 16px and works best at multiples of 16, although most icons are clear down to 10px and even below. It's designed to be simple, straightforward, and easy to read. Each icon is designed carefully to a base 16 grid, curves are minimized, and line weights are thick to stand up at smaller sizes.
